# code_school

Would you like to learn to code? How about we learn together!!!

Code School is a program that combines learning resources in Udemy(suggestions below) with weekly office hour access to Spiff software engineers to ask questions or go through projects.

We're still sorting everything out over time but come join us! Every Wednesday at 3pm Mountain Time on zoom https://spiff.zoom.us/j/88089581749?pwd=TEVTajl5WUZ1SkFMR1I5VXpyR09NQT09. If you want a calendar invite please reach out to matthew.banbury@spiff.com or @banbury in spiff slack.

Also join us in the #code-school channel and ask questions throughout the week and get async assistance.
