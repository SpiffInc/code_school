# code_school

Would you like to learn to code? How about we learn together!!!

Code School is a program that combines learning resources in Udemy(suggestions below) with weekly office hour access to Spiff software engineers to ask questions or go through projects.

We meet twice a week and both meetings are optional and get you access to engineers to ask questions.

Tuesdays from 10:00am-10:30am Mountain
Wednesdays from 3:00pm-4:00pm Mountain 

All the meetings are held on zoom at https://spiff.zoom.us/j/88089581749?pwd=TEVTajl5WUZ1SkFMR1I5VXpyR09NQT09. 

If you want a calendar invite please reach out to matthew.banbury@spiff.com or @banbury in spiff slack.

Also join us in the #code-school channel and ask questions throughout the week and get async assistance.
